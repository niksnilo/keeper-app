# Keeper

- This project called Keeper App build with REACT
- As of now there is no database and I'm using props and arrays to create a temporary storage
- **Keeper v4** will feature a database: MongoDB.
- Live Demo ***https://nvnqc.csb.app/***

## CodeSandBox

- If you visit CodeSandbox you'll see the keeper app from **Keeper v1** to **Keeper v3** which is the current version
